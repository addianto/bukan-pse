# Bukan PSE

A Web data crawler for obtaining PSE registration data exposed by the public API
endpoints at [PSE registration system](https://pse.kominfo.go.id).

## Getting Started

Install the required Python packages:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the main entrypoint script:

```shell
python main.py
```

The script now only fetches local registered PSE. If you need to fetch
other type of PSE data, you can modify the script.
